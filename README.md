This is a DOOM wad file made for the MVROP Honors Biomedical Innovations course for the 2021-2022 school year. It is created using the Eureka Doom Editor on Arch Linux. Custom textures were created and edited using the SLADE editor, running from WINE. To load this wad, you will need the `Hell on Earth` wad, which was crated by Seargant Mark IV. 

The load order is `Hell on Earth`, then `customTextures`, then `map`.

This project taught me through the basics of Doom mapping, specifically textures, doors, 3D sectors, and teleporters. If you want to edit this using Eureka, reading the docs has been really informative.
